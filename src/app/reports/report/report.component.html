        <p class="lead">
            South Africa’s economy under pressure after recent credit rating cuts to junk by major rating agencies.
        </p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            It is well known that South Africa’s economy has not been going too well in the recent years. Political instability, socio-economic
            issues and slow economic growth – a downgrading was long due. Even though predictions for this year’s GDP went
            slightly up to 1% due to a moderate rebound in commodity prices and a comeback in agricultural production (corn-production
            is expected to be the highest since 1981), the country could now face a further downgrading by rating agencies.
            South African ministers met with S&P Global Ratings officials on Monday, 22/05/2017, as they want to avoid another
            downgrade. S&P will make another rating announcement on June 2, while also Moody’s has placed the country under
            review for a downgrade.
        </p>

        <h2>Political</h2>

        <p>
            Increased political risk which will remain elevated this year due to controversy surrounding President Jacob Zuma and the
            ANC. A cabinet reshuffle in which 10 of 35 ministers were fired is the main cause of downgrades from Moody’s,
            S&P and Fitch. Zuma replaced Finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, who was considered a bulwark2 against government
            corruption. The new ministers, are largely unknown to investors which could create further uncertainty in SA’s
            financial markets. The reshuffle was done without ANC’s approval. Therefore, internal government and party divisions
            could delay fiscal and structural reforms. Overall: Increased likelihood that economic growth and fiscal outcomes
            could suffer.3 Political uncertainty in SA is a consequence of low growth for social stability and suffering
            industrial relations, especially in the mining sector.
        </p>

        <h2>Economy</h2>

        <h3>Recent developments</h3>

        <p>
            Medium-term growth prospects are poor due to structural weaknesses, including continuing energy shortages, rising interest
            rates, further capital outflows and less supportive capital market environment. In addition, low consumer and
            business confidence 4has been putting further pressure on growth of economic activity, however there is a noticeable,
            slight upward trend. Slow progress in delivering economic and social services in townships and rural areas, hence
            government is behind their expectations with their key government policies. Real GDP growth declined each year
            from 2013 until 2016, from 2.48% in 2013 to 0.28% in 2016. Real economic growth turned negative in 2016Q4.
            Main contributor to the economy’s slowdown is an 11.5% drop in the mining’s sector production.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unemployment has risen from 2013 until 2016, from respectively 24.73% up to 27.1% in 2016Q4. An increasing Debt-To-GDP
            Ratio from 47.1% in 2014 to 52% in 2016 is one indicator of the low-growth environment. Following the negative
            economic environment, South Africa’s credit rating has recently been downgraded to junk status by all major rating
            agencies. Standard & Poor’s and Fitch rate SA now with BB+ whereas Moody’s downgraded the debt rating to Baa2
            from Baa1. South African 10 year bond yields have been falling since the beginning of the year, however this
            caused the bond yields to a new high in 2017 and a further weakening of the rand. Since that high at 9.22% on
            10th of April the 10 year bond yield fell to 8.62%. A weak rand is pushing up inflation which increases pressure
            on SA’s Reserve Bank. Inflation in 2016 was at 6.3% above the central bank’s target of 3-6%.
        </p>


        <h3>Short to medium-term outlook</h3>

        <p>
            Fiscal policy is now under pressure from the recent ratings downgrades. Continued increase in government debt, higher borrowing
            rates, low growth and high inflation provide a weak economic environment which has led to further capital outflow
            in the past weeks. A weaker rand also means higher import prices for consumers, even though it might further
            boost tourism in South Africa. Under the given conditions it seems like that the economy is not likely to increase
            the pace of recovery and it is unlikely to prevent a further increase in unemployment. The strong institutional
            framework built on accountability and transparency which the South African treasury claims as one of its strengths,
            can in fact only be seen when looking at the central bank and exactly this puts pressure on president Zuma. SA’s
            exports account for about 30% of its GDP and as China’s growth is slowing down (China is the single-largest export
            destinations for SA), so are South Africa’s exports. This is due to an appreciation of the USD and a devaluation
            of the RMB, so both the currencies highly effect SA’s trade and should be looked at closely. In addition, South
            Africa will need to refinance about $18b maturing bonds this year – about 12% of its total issuance - according
            to Reuters data. This could prove costly for South Africa with further increasing bond yields.
        </p>

        <h2>Central Bank</h2>

        <p>
            The MPC decided in January to keep the interest rate unchanged at 7%. The inflation outlook would have improved (due to
            a further appreciation of the rand) according to the MPC meeting from 30th of March. This outlook might be in
            need of adjustment due to recent credit rating downgrades leading to a stop in the appreciation of the rand.
            As anticipated in their last meeting, political uncertainty has weakened the outlook for the rand. Overall, as
            indicated in last S&P report, the SARB has a track record in achieving price stability, flexibility in its monetary
            policy remains and is considered as independently operating. The exchange rate regime in South Africa is a floating
            one, i.e. a non-targeted interest rate. Next MPC Meetings: 23-25 May, 18-20 July, 19-21 September
        </p>


        <h2>Financial Markets</h2>

        <p>
            South Africa’s most important stock index, the FTSE/JSE (JALSH) is down from 54,666 to 54,453 (As of 22th of May 4:45 pm)
            index points (ZAR). Due to a deterioration in sovereign creditworthiness, risks to the banking sector increase. This
            is likely to negatively affect bank’s financial metrics, and therefore knock-on effects on profitability and
            capital. S&P already had downgraded the banks Nedbank, Absa, Investec and FirstRand to non-investment grade BB+
            on 6th of April to fall in line with the country’s credit rating. Johannesburg's Banks Index had subsequently
            lost 10 , but came back and is now around 6% lower since March 27.
        </p>


        <h2>Credit Ratings</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>S&P: BB + (April 2017) and negative Outlook</li>
            <li>Moody’s: Baa2 (April 2017) and stable Outlook</li>
            <li>Fitch: BB+ (April 2017) and stable outlook</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
            The country could now drop out of some widely used global bond index which rely on investment grades and consequently $15b
            in investment funds are at risk to flow out of South Africa6. If South Africa cannot maintain the remaining investment-grade
            rating of local-currency debt, then rand-denominated bonds will be excluded of those indices. Subsequent capital
            outflows and increasing borrowing costs, would add further pressure on the rand.
        </p>

        <p>
            Investors now will have to look at the new rating announcements by Moody’s and S&P. South Africa’s Central Bank has limited
            room for stimulus through macroeconomic policies and policy rates are expected to remain on hold since headline
            inflation is expected to return to 5.9% in 2017 which is below the 6% target. Thus, the priority to stimulate
            economic growth and job creation can only be achieved through fiscal stimulus: structural reforms, above all
            in product and service markets and in the labour market.
        </p>

        <p>
            Current economic prospects for South Africa are poor. Low expectations for economic growth, at a rate lower than population
            growth, within the next 2 years and ongoing political uncertainties will be main issues investors will face when
            making investment decisions in South Africa.
