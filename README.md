# Misc help for developers and contributors
> Don't worry about the below unless you want to edit and contribute to this project.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Build

Run `npm build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Travis CI

Tests are run automatically with Travis CI.
Travis CI is a hosted, distributed continuous integration service used to build and test software projects hosted at GitHub. You can check my Travis CI build here:

[https://travis-ci.org/dolanmiu/qmtis-website](https://travis-ci.org/dolanmiu/qmtis-website)

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `npm start`.

## Deployments

### Heroku

This project is automatically deployed to Heroku here:

[https://qmtis.herokuapp.com](https://qmtis.herokuapp.com/).

To make this work on Heroku, I had to create a simple Express server to serve the static files.
It uses a `Procfile`, which launches the tiny Express server `server.js`, which serves the `/dist` folder
I would not use this in practice, but for this project, Heroku works nicely.

### Deploying to Github Pages

This requires `angular-cli`. Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to Github Pages.

## Further help

To get more help on the `angular-cli` use `ng --help` or go check out the [Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
